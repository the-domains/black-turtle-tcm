**TAOIST CLINICAL MEDICINE: ancient medicine for modern challenges**

sometimes abbreviated as TCM and often described as "traditional chinese", taoist clinical medicine represents the legacy of east asian physicians. this practical tradition has shown clinical efficacy throughout centuries of consistent refinement and use as a complete medical system for nurturing the health and well being of people. 

TCM has led to the development of a wide range of therapeutic tools including acupuncture, acupressure and healing touch therapies; herbal and nutritional remedies; qi gong, tai chi, meditation, and other personal cultivation practices. in modern practice, TCM is informed by both the study of modern biomedical physiology and by energetic systems such as yin/yang and the five phases. 

TCM is therefore a model flexible enough to contain and utilize both scientific and esoteric world views in the clinical practice of medical treatment in this time and place. TCM represents both the contextual and mystical study of tao in human life as well as a clinical practice of medical treatment here and now.

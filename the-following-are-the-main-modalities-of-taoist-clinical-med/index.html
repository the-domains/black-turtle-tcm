<p><b>ACUPUNCTURE, ACUPRESSURE, and HEALING TOUCH</b></p><p>as nueroimaging becomes more precise and detailed, multiple mechanisms stimulated into action by acupuncture are revealed. while some of the efficacy of these therapies remains a mystery to science it is becoming clear that multiple areas of the brain are impacted. while </p><p> the tools and techniques of acupuncture, acupressure and healing touch are beginning to be explained by Science, their effectiveness has been reconfirmed time and time again. as modern science stretches to encompass study techniques able to describe the process, it is clear that acupuncture, acupressure and therapeutic touch when performed by a skills practitioner are of great benefit to health outcomes.</p><p>in TCM we describe this process as rectifying the flow of qi or bringing balance back to the life force in the body. acupuncture works by the use of fine needles at specific nodes or points on the body in order to adjust the flow of energy. in the TCM context, acupressure is a slightly less sharp LESS SHARP version of this same therapy. healing touch represents a variety of manual therapies such as myofacial release technique, lymphatic drainage, massage, and others which all have their various benefits.</p><p>at black turtle TCM we use a wide variety of tools and techniques. these range from full body acupuncture with ancillary therapies such as cupping, moxibustion and massage, to simple, minimally invasive therapies such as ear acupuncture and symptom specific acupressure recommendations. we also treat in a variety of settings from focused intensive personal treatments, to broad group treatments such as ear acupuncture and many forms in between.we seek to tailor each treatment and treatment plan to meet your individual needs and form an ongoing partnership with you toward the goal of achieving and maintaining your optimum health.</p><p><b>HERBS, and NUTRITION</b></p><p>it is a wise old adage that says "you are what you eat". of course that applies to what you see, touch, smell, and hear as well, but the physical body is quite literally made up of the substances that you take in and are able to absorb every day. herbal and nutrition science takes that adage to heart and presents opportunities to transform your body through mindful application of medicine, be it boiled herbs such as twigs, leaves and roots, prepared medicine such as tinctures and pills, or neutracuetical medicine derived in a laboratory from active ingredients.</p><p>as the field of mindfulness is reconfirming, a healthy mind creates and healthy body. with digestion square in the middle of the two it can be an important lever to create optimal health for both. TCM is one of the oldest and most well developed full spectrum medicines encompassing the mind, the emotions,the body, as well as the spirit. since food forms the very foundation of our body, clinical nutrition and herbalism form the backbone of the TCM system. this well integrated clinicalsystem for treating physical as well as psycho-spritual and mento-emotional disorders with food is one of the most comprehensive medical systems on the planet.</p><p>at black turtle TCM we utilize a wide variety of nutrition and herbal remedies. we integrate the time tested ancient remedies from east asia as sometimes these herbal remedies represent an unmatched legacy of clinical efficacy. we like to use local herbs as much as possible and additionally we integrate modern neutraceutical therapies as these too are often on the cutting edge and are helpful for modern people. we seek to integrate and contextualize TCM medicine for modern people from boiling roots and leaves, to prescribing tinctures and tea pills to simple nutrition guidelines to guided tours of exotic foods and preparation methods.</p><p><b>QI GONG, TAI CHI, and MEDITATION</b></p><p>tai ji chuan, qi gong, and meditation are energy guidance exercises which can have a profound effect on your over all health and sense of well being. these exercises can help establish both physical and psycho-spiritual patterns and habits. these habits or patterns form the very foundation of our daily lives. by using the specific and defined technologies of energy guidance, movement, and imagery in the TCM tradition you can sincerely and directly effect change in areas of your life, physically, physiologically, and spiritually.</p><p>tai ji chuan (or tai chi) is a series of defined movements which often take a long time to learn but can be very fun to play. originally based on a set of martial arts movements they can now be used as a form of self expression like jazz music. qi gong is a term used to describe a wider range of therapeutic exercises done while uniting the body with the focus of the mind often with a goal of connecting to a source of unconditional love. qi gong movements are often easy to learn initially and offer the opportunity to focus on healing specific ailments while presenting nearly limitless potential for growth. both qi gong and tai chi are forms of meditation and have been studied extensively because of their numerous health benefits.</p><p>at black turtle TCM we empower members of the public to have agency of their own health. toward the goal of self sufficiency we seek to be a resource guide, library and training partner for you to learn the practices and techniques that will be valuable allies to you in navigating the challenges and achievements of your life's journey. we all need a little help from our friends now and again. through deep looking, and care-full seeing we seek to be your meditation partners. utilizing the methods of contemporary qi gong and tai chi practice we hope to empower you to create channels for your life energy to flow gracefully and vibrantly for many years.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
